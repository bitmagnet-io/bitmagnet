# Servarr Integration

**bitmagnet**'s HTTP server exposes an endpoint at `/torznab`, allowing it to integrate with any application that supports [the Torznab specification](https://torznab.github.io/spec-1.3-draft/index.html), most notably apps in [the Servarr stack](https://wiki.servarr.com/) (Prowlarr, Sonarr, Radarr etc.).

## Adding **bitmagnet** as an indexer in Prowlarr

To get started, open your Prowlarr instance, click "Add Indexer", and select "Generic Torznab" from the list.

The required settings are fairly basic. Assuming you've adapted from the [example docker-compose file]({% link setup/installation.md %}#docker), and Prowlarr is on the same Docker network as **bitmagnet**, then Prowlarr should be able to access the Torznab endpoint of your **bitmagnet** instance at `http://bitmagnet:3333/torznab`. No further configuration should be needed, just click the "Test" button to ensure everything is working.

[Depending on your Prowlarr configuration](https://wiki.servarr.com/prowlarr/settings#applications), the **bitmagnet** indexer should now be synced to your other \*arr applications. Alternatively, you can add **bitmagnet** as an indexer directly in those applications, following the same steps as above.
