(Warning) If you have a tracing set up for Promtail, it cannot be migrated to Flow Mode automatically. Refer to the documentation on how to configure tracing in Flow Mode.
(Warning) The Agent's Flow Mode metrics are different from the metrics emitted by Promtail. If you rely on Promtail's metrics, you must change your configuration, for example, your alerts and dashboards.
